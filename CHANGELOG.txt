## [v1.0.0-alpha2] - 09.02.2019
- NBS-Predict is now in v1.0.0-alpha2.
- Fix several bugs in the GUI.
- Fix bug in correlation metric. 
- Change default parameters for searching algorithms. Now they have more liberal parameters (e.g., reduced number of iterations).
- Add function to control confounds.
- Add a menu in GUI to choose a scaling method.
- SVM Regression is now built-in function instead of LIBSVM.
- Add Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Add MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler and MaxAbsScaler
- LIBSVM is now removed. Instead, builtin SVM functions are now available to use. They give the same prediction performance as LIBSVM, but are significantly faster. 
- Add preprocessing step in shrinkMat function, that features where information is less than 10% are removed. In this way, very sparse features are now removed. It might be increased to 20% in future updates.
